# YouTube Music Downloader
A simple Python script to download YouTube Music playlists, albums or tracks by providing a link. By default, tracks are downloaded at AAC 128k, but you can also get AAC 256k if a YouTube Music Premium cookies.txt is placed at the same directory as this script. Tags are fetched from YouTube Music itself.

### Requirements
    pip install yt_dlp mutagen ytmusicapi
You will also need ffmpeg installed in your system.

Special thanks to Patrick Timm for helping me out in this project.
