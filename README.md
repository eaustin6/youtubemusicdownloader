# Youtube Album Downloader
This script downloads entire YouTube Music albums by prodividing a link and tags and files them using YouTube Music API. By default, it will download tracks at AAC 128k, but it can also do AAC 256k if a YouTube Music Premium cookies.txt is placed at the same directory as this script.

### Requirements
    pip install yt_dlp mutagen
