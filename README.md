# YouTube Music Downloader
This script downloads YouTube Music albums, playlists or tracks by prodividing a link and tags files using YouTube Music API. By default, tracks will be downloaded at AAC 128k, but it can also do AAC 256k if a YouTube Music Premium cookies.txt is placed at the same directory as this script.

### Requirements
    pip install yt_dlp mutagen ytmusicapi
You will also need ffmpeg installed in your system.

Special thanks to Patrick Timm for helping me out in this project.
